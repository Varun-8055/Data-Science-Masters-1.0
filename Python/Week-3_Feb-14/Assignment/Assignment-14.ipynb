    "1). What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed context switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multitasking is a computer's ability to execute two or more concurrent programs. Multithreading makes multitasking possible when it breaks programs into smaller, executable threads. Each thread has the programming elements needed to execute the main program, and the computer executes each thread one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading Modules. The threading module is a high-level implementation of multithreading used to deploy an application in Python. To use multithreading, we need to import the threading module in Python Program."

    " \n",
    " <B>Activecount() </B>:The activeCount() method of thread class is used to return the number of active threads in the current thread's thread group. The value returned is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal data structures.\n",
